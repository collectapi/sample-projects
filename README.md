# Collectapi Sample Projects

> Community contributed samples for the Collectapi services.

# Philosophy

* Folder Standard:
    * Sample folder should start with code language synonym and contain either used api name or short description with snake case standard. For example "python_gas_prices", "nodejs_how_to_create_simple_api".
    * Samples should contain own .gitignore file.

* Writing good samples:
    * A good sample shows how to do one thing and only one thing at a time.
    * A good sample follows good and consistent code style.
    * When arbitrary choices are made, a good sample chooses the simplest default.
    * Samples must be willing to teach programming as well as the API!
